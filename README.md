## Project Overview
A trip planning app, which allows users to choose potential cities to visit based on their individual temperature preferences.  In the identification of potential cities, potential hotels within those cities are also identified.
Further, there is functionality to select cities of similar temperatures within an individual country and provide directions to travel to up to four cities within that country.
